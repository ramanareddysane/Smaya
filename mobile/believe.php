						<p> Your battery life matters to you. You matter to us, so your battery life matters to us too. 
						Bluetooth drains battery only if something is being transferred or received, not when simply 
						switching ON. We assure you that. Sleep well, your battery is great, only when you decrease 
						your overall phone usage though.</p>
					<p> Other person know when you are near if and only if you granted him permission to do so when 
							accepting his/her requests and we know you accept people only you know. </p>		
					<p> You may switch off notifications any time in the day with just a tap of a button. Not only that
					we feel bad when we irritate you, we try our best not to, we can go on fast to see you happy. WE care for you. </p>	
					<p> You can switch off connections with any one, anytime, we understand not everyone are made to stick together lifelong. 
					(But please try to understand this fact, relations are important, think twice.) </p>

						<p>We know there are some security issues regarding making Bluetooth discoverable.
						But let us assure you with today's Bluetooth you need pairing to access information and high expertise of hacking to hack information.</p><p>
						We are not degrading hackers, they can hack anything. We are trying hard to prevent that. Your Bluetooth will be switched 
						off immediately if our app found out some unauthorised pairing. When you switch ON the internet we will get the information 
						about the pairing and we will make it secure further. Believe us, we will be striving hard to secure your information.</p><p>
						Though we love hackers, we know all are not good ones, we'll be hiring the good ones to attack the bad ones and our
						good ones are better. We assure your safety.</p><p>
						As time progresses we will be investing more on this and we will come up with more app security.</p><p>
						And as they say being on net means, you can be hacked, keeping your Bluetooth means you can be hacked, it's just that how hard it is to hack. 
						We will try our level best to make it harder. So sleep well, you are safe.
