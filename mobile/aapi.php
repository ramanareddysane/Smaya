					<h3 > Offline </h3>
					<p>  When you install Aapi world, it asks for a permission to switch on Bluetooth and make it discoverable. Aapi world solely
					 depends on Bluetooth for connecting people offline.</p>
					 <p> You can send two types of requests to every Aapi world user,<br>
						<ul style="text-align:left;list-style-type:devanagari;">
							<li>Real Aapi request</li>
							<li>Aapi request</li>
						</ul>
					 </p>	
				<p>Choose people whom you consider close and add them into your Real Aapi list by sending Real Aapi request. Real Aapi list is a list
				of close people whose presence you want to be notified and when being with whom you want to get notifications 
				when fixed to the phone.</p> 
				<p> Aapi list is a list of online friends whom you add by sending Aapi request. </p>
				<p>Real Aapi list is a list confined to 20 people. You can set priority, drag and drop people from Aapi list, though you need a 
				special permission from the user. </p>
					<p>Get notified when people in your Real Aapi list comes near to you, so that
				you don't miss any chance to meet people close to you in real world.</p>
				<p>   Get notified when you are involved in your smartphone to smile at a stranger
				   when he/she having the app comes and stand beside you (very close).
				   Building humanity together. If you have just a while back, smiled at a stranger, 
				   no notification will  come to smile at another for 10 minutes even though lot of 
				   strangers pass by you.</p>
				   <p>      Get notified while you are using your phone when you are with someone you love.
					   Aapi world knows, when the person is too close and when he/she is far away with the help 
					   of Bluetooth range. If it recognises you are too close to that person, assuming that without
					   talking to him/her, you are fixed to your phone, you'll get notified. Incase if you are not using
					   your phone or your friend is just in range but not too close you'll not be notified as it assumes
					   either you are enjoying with that person without using your phone or the person is not near and you
					   are alone, it never irritates you.
					   <p> All your meetings are stored in your offline tag, so that you can share your experience online. </p>

						<h3> Online </h3>
						<p>Aapi world uses Internet for ONLINE connections.	</p>
						<p>Aapi world is a world of Aapis (your friends) with whom you share expriences in the form of photos,
						videos, statuses etc. It is a world of people from different parts of the real world who share different 
						types of experiences to the community, which helps other people of the community to evolve. </p>
						<p>Aapi world contains Aapi clubs, which are based on an interest, a passion or an organisation, 
						company etc., which you follow, where you can learn and evolve	</p>
						<p> Users tag their experiences to the Aapi clubs. Based on the upvotes and downvotes, some exeriences will top the club and they 
						appear on the feed of users who followed those clubs. Generally the most liked one is a 
						great post. They can be shared into your wall. Thus learning and evolving, sticking to our vision of seeing people 
						connect with more genius people around the world and evolve. </p>
					    <p> Community experience sharing, differentiating the wall so that you can get direct access to your friends 
						posts or some great shared posts by your friends, not any bullshit are some features.</p>
						<p>These are some important features and there's lot more on the release day. Stay tuned and keep loving.
						When we release you'll definitely be amazed, we assure.</p>

						<p>	For offline connections we don't use internet, we use your Bluetooth,
						thus saving you some money and making it lot easier to connect.</p>
						<p> So we need your Bluetooth to be switched ON and made discoverable.</p>
						<p>We know you are afraid of battery issues and security issues caused by this.
							We assure you most part of that is just a myth. </p>
						<p> Bluetooth causes battery drain only if something is being transferred or received 
						not when you keep your phone's Bluetooth is switched ON. Yes there'll be a fraction of
						battery loss, but it's negligible enough to ignore as we know it doesn't affect you 
						much as it is very less compared to battery loss when data connection is switched on and 
						when WiFi connected to a network.</p>
						<p>Regarding security issues, yes Bluetooth has some loop holes. We are trying 
							hard and we will be trying hard to protect you from any such attacks. Check 
							our <a href="believe.php" style="color:#E31717">'Believe Us'</a> section to know how we are tackling this issue. </p>
